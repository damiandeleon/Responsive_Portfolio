# Responsive_Portfolio
the purpose of this project was to create a responsive portfolio which will eventually showcase my work as well as serve as a way to be contacted by users. The site pages are responsive to different viewports.  The user can navigate the site throught nav bar at the top, which will shrink to a hamburger menu when the screen width is adjusted.

## About/Index Page
The About/Index Page will serve as the landing page of the website with navigation tools at the top.  This will have my picture as well as a description about me which will be filled out more detailed at a later time.

This was designed by Bootstrap using the card form.  Through small manipulation of the margins and padding I was able to to make it visually desirable and tailored for my use.

## Contact Page
The Contact page will serve as the way for users to contact me.  They will enter their name, their email address and any text they would like to include in their message.  This was used by Bootstrap form tools. 

## Portfolio Page
This page will showcase the my work as I progress through the class.  The formatting will wrap picture placeholders as the page shrinks.
